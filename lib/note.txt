To Solve CORS when complied in Web:

1. Login to Google Cloud Console / Install Google Cloud CLI
    - Open your web browser and go to Google Cloud Console.
    - Log in with your Google account.

2. Select Your Firebase Project
    - In the top-left menu, select the Firebase project associated with your storage bucket.

3. Activate Google Cloud Shell
    - Click on the “Activate Google Cloud Shell” icon located in the upper right corner of the console.
    - A shell terminal will appear at the bottom of your window, with gcloud and gsutil already available.

4. Create a CORS Configuration File
    - In the Cloud Shell terminal, execute the following command to create a JSON file named cors-config.json:
    - echo '[{"origin": ["*"], "method": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],"maxAgeSeconds": 3600,"responseHeader": ["Content-Type", "Authorization"]}]' > cors-config.json

5. Apply the CORS Configuration to Your Storage Bucket
    - Replace YOUR_BUCKET_NAME with your actual bucket name. You can find your bucket name in the Firebase Console under Storage.
    - Copy the bucket name in the format gs://your-bucket-name.
    - Execute the following command in the Cloud Shell terminal to apply the CORS configuration: gsutil cors set cors-config.json gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME

6. Verify the CORS Configuration
    - To check if the CORS settings were applied correctly, run the following command: gsutil cors get gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
